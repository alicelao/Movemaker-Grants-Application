6. Which funding category are you applying for?  
Developer Education & Ecosystem

7. Product Stage  
Product Market Fit (Bitskwela has established itself as a leading Web3 education platform in the Philippines with a proven track record, partnerships, and a growing user base of over 100,000.)

8. Introduction to your project  
Bitskwela is a Philippine-based EdTech platform dedicated to accelerating Web3 adoption by providing inclusive, multilingual, and accessible education to Filipinos. Our mission is to guide the remaining 97% of the Philippines—approximately 100 million people—from curiosity to active participation in Web3, empowering them to "own a piece of the internet." We achieve this through a full-stack approach, offering educational courses, events, guides, content, and regional activations in partnership with key stakeholders across public and private sectors.  
We want to work on this because the Philippines is one of the fastest-growing markets for blockchain adoption globally, with high crypto usage, NFT ownership, and government openness to the technology. By bridging the gap between interest and participation through education, we aim to unlock this potential and establish Bitskwela as the premier Web3 education brand in the region, replicable across Southeast Asia.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?  
The problem we address is the lack of accessible, localized, and trustworthy Web3 education for the masses, particularly in emerging markets like the Philippines. Despite high adoption rates, many Filipinos lack the foundational knowledge to confidently engage with blockchain technologies, leading to missed opportunities and potential exploitation. This is critical because education drives sustainable adoption, empowers users, and expands the market for blockchain protocols. With the Philippines’ unique position—high social media usage, a remittance-driven economy, and growing institutional support—solving this problem can catalyze mass Web3 adoption regionally and globally.

10. What is your proposed solution?  
Our solution is a full-stack educational and marketing ecosystem that simplifies complex Web3 concepts into digestible, multilingual content (e.g., English, Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano) and deploys it through nationwide channels. We offer:  
- Educational Materials: Simplified whitepapers, guides, and courses tailored to local languages and cultures.  
- Marketing Activations: Events, KOL campaigns, learn-to-earn initiatives, and university outreach to convert interest into action.  
- Partnerships: Collaboration with protocols like Aptos, government bodies, and private enterprises to amplify reach and credibility.  
By combining education with strategic marketing, we onboard users—retail, developers, and institutions—into the Aptos ecosystem with a solid understanding of its value.

11. Any competitions?  
While there are Web3 education initiatives globally (e.g., Binance Academy, Coinbase Learn), few focus on the Philippines with a localized, full-stack approach. Local alternatives like Museigen Training Academy exist but lack Bitskwela’s scale, partnerships, and multilingual offerings. Our solution stands out due to:  
- Minimal competition in the Philippine Web3 education space.  
- A proven track record with major protocols (e.g., Polkadot, Aptos, Lido) and institutions (e.g., DICT, Globe).  
- A cumulative digital footprint of 50 million+ and a community of 100,000+ users.

12. Why Aptos?  
Aptos aligns with Bitskwela’s mission due to its focus on scalability, developer accessibility, and mass adoption—key pillars for onboarding Filipinos into Web3. As a protocol emphasizing education and ecosystem growth, Aptos benefits from our expertise in simplifying technical narratives and reaching untapped markets. Our prior collaboration (Bitskwela is trusted by Aptos) and the Philippines’ high-growth potential make this partnership a natural fit to drive user acquisition and developer engagement on Aptos.
