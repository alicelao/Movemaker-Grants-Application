6. Which funding category are you applying for?
Infrastructure (Jovo.IO builds infrastructure to integrate blockchain assets into retail systems)

7. Product Stage
Product Market Fit (Jovo.IO is live on 3 marketplaces, has integrated 2 chains with 10 more in the pipeline, and has recorded daily sales since December 2023)

8. Introduction to your project
Jovo.IO is a digital goods marketplace that bridges blockchain-based assets (NFTs, tokenized items) with existing retail ecosystems like online stores, marketplaces, and ERP systems. Based in Singapore and backed by a AAA financial partner, we aim to bring digital products to the 1 billion+ people not yet active in crypto by integrating with platforms like eBay, Lazada, and eventually Amazon, where people already shop. We started with a simple question—“Why can’t I buy Adidas NFTs where I buy Adidas shoes?”—and built a solution to make blockchain accessible without technical barriers. We’re live, growing, and passionate about expanding the crypto ecosystem.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
The crypto ecosystem is limited to a niche audience due to technical complexity and fragmented infrastructure (wallets, exchanges, etc.). Over 1 billion people don’t interact with blockchain because it’s not where they already are—mainstream retail platforms. This restricts adoption and growth. Jovo.IO solves this by bringing digital goods to familiar marketplaces, eliminating the need for crypto-specific education or tools, and making blockchain accessible to a massive untapped audience.

10. What is your proposed solution?
Our solution is an infrastructure layer that integrates blockchain assets (starting with Ethereum and Polygon, expanding to Solana, Aptos, etc.) into retail systems like marketplaces, ERPs, and checkouts. We handle the technical complexity—APIs, wallet connections (e.g., WalletConnect), and cross-chain compatibility—so creators and brands can sell tokenized goods (e.g., NFTs) directly on platforms like eBay or Lazada. We also run targeted social media campaigns (e.g., TikTok) to drive adoption, leveraging our tech to connect 500M+ users to blockchain without them needing to leave their preferred shopping environments.

11. Any competitions?
Competitors include OpenSea, Amazon, and G2A. OpenSea is crypto-native but limited to its platform, requiring technical know-how. Amazon and G2A sell digital goods but lack blockchain integration. Jovo.IO stands out by bringing blockchain assets to existing retail ecosystems with zero customer education needed, offering a seamless, scalable solution that expands the crypto universe far beyond niche platforms.

12. Why Aptos?
Aptos offers a high-performance, scalable blockchain with a growing ecosystem, making it ideal for integrating digital goods into retail at scale. Its focus on developer tooling and infrastructure aligns with our mission to simplify blockchain access. By adding Aptos, we can tap into its innovative Move language and robust transaction capabilities, enhancing our cross-chain offerings and bringing Aptos-based assets to millions of non-crypto shoppers, boosting its adoption and visibility.
