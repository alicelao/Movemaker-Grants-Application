8. Introduction to your project
Tashi Protocol is building the 'Forever Game' Protocol to revolutionize multiplayer gaming through decentralized infrastructure. With games spending over $40 Billion on network costs, Tashi empowers developers with a fully decentralized peer-to-peer multiplayer model that significantly reduces infrastructure costs by ∼ 50%, thereby extending the commercial lifespan of games. Tashi has added a trust layer in the P2P model via its proprietary consensus protocol, with sub-50ms latency (10x faster than other protocols) to ensure fair, cheat-resistant gameplay without relying on centralized servers.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
The problem Tashi Protocol is solving is the high network costs and latency issues in Web3 gaming, which hinder the adoption of decentralized gaming. By removing the need for centralized servers and gas fees, Tashi Protocol aims to make decentralized gaming more accessible and inclusive for everyone. This is important because it will accelerate the shift towards decentralized gaming, creating a more inclusive and accessible gaming environment.

10. What is your proposed solution?
Tashi Protocol's solution is a decentralized gaming infrastructure that runs consensus on every player’s computer, enabling peer-to-peer gaming. This solution significantly lowers entry barriers for developers and gamers alike, as it removes the need for centralized servers and gas fees. By doing so, it allows for a new generation of gamers to enter the Web3 space effortlessly.

11. Any competitions?
Tashi Protocol does not have direct competition within the Apple ecosystem, but it competes with other Web3 gaming platforms that rely on centralized servers and gas fees.

12. Why Aptos?
Aptos is chosen as the platform for Tashi Protocol because it offers a high-performance, secure, and scalable blockchain that can support the needs of decentralized gaming. Aptos's focus on security and scalability aligns well with Tashi Protocol's mission to provide a robust, reliable, and efficient gaming infrastructure.
